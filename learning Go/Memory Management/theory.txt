Memory management
In go lang memory management(allocation adn deallocation) happens automatically

new() -> allocate memory but not initalised
-> you will get a memory address
-> zeroed storage -> you cannot put data initially

-----------------------------------------------------

make() -> allocate memory and initalised
you will get a memeory address
non - zeroed storage -> you can put any data

// in majority of the cases we will be usig make()

// runtime is a package in go lang just in case if you want to get information
// like how much cpu is available   

garbage collection - > there's a thresold value of which value is set 
if you try to change it value more than that garbage collection gets triggered
